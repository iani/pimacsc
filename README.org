This repository contains libraries needed to make SuperCollider run on EMACS plus a script for linking these to the appropriate places on a RaspBerry Pi, and an emacs-lisp file for setting the configuration needed to run SuperCollider on EMACS.

- scemacs :: SuperCollider Library for connecting to EMACS.
- sclang :: Emacs Library for connecting to SuperCollider.
- sclang/install.el : Script for installing this library on a raspberry pi

* Installation

On your raspberry pi shell, get the library from GitHub:

: cd ~/ # switch to home directory
: git clone git@github.com:iani/pimacsc.git # download the library from GitHub

On emacs, evaluate the following expression to load the install script:

: (load-file "/home/pi/pimacsc/sclang/install.el")
