My own copy of sclang from the SuperCollider 3.7alpha source code distro.

Reasons:

1) Have it readily available instead of having to download the entire SC source code repo from git every time.
2) Install it using [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]].

El-get recipe:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(:name sclang :url "https://github.com/iani/sclang.git"
       :type git
       :features (sclang)
       :after nil)
#+END_SRC
